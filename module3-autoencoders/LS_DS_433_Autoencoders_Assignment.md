1. Why do you think it took ~10 years to get any sort of funding for AI if the first AI program showed great promise to the future of technology?
2. As AI starts to improve each year, what are your thoughts on the potential thought of AI robots replacing humans for jobs and potentially leaving people unemployed?
3. As seen in movies of robots "taking over the world", do you think that could be a possibility in the future with the constant improvement of AGI?
