    "It is worth spending a moment considering the double-edged sword that is automation. This story did not begin with artificial intelligence, or even statistics or mathematics - it began when the first tool inventor figured out how to make something clever like a lever or a wheel, and use it to reduce the amount of labor needed to achieve some task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern day we talk about automation, but in practice most technology is best considered as a *productivity multiplier* - all businesses still need at least *some* humans around, if nothing else to make policy decisions and collect profit. But the productivity of each individual person can be greatly enhanced through the use of technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider farming - formerly a signification source of employment (and also small family owned farms), technology has tranformed it into a large scale industry where a handful of people produce as much as many more did before. This progression has happened in many areas - fortunately, it is usually accompanied by job growth and opportunity as new markets and services are created by technology as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, is it different now? Maybe - \"history will say\" is the only safe stance. But we are automating work at an accelerating rate, and it's unclear where all this growth is going and where the opportunities will be. There's a pretty good bet that it'll involve computers and data - and that's probably a large part of why you're here!\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is not to convince you of anything - it is just to make you think. As a Data Scientist, you will have an outsized impact on society, and it is your responsibility to consider that impact and what you want to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important caveat** - think and engage with society, *but* strive to not be strident or unduly certain when you do so. Broadcasting political beliefs, especially while on the job market, usually closes more doors than it opens. So, consider perspectives, and encourage dialogue - don't just (re)broadcast outrage at the latest injustice."

The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans. — Nick Bostrom\n",

Killer robot armies make for good TV, but at some step there's likely a human with an off switch."
