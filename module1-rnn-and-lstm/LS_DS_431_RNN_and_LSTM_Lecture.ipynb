    "Wish you could save [Time In A Bottle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnWWj6xOleY)? With statistics you can do the next best thing - understand how data varies over time (or any sequential order), and use the order/time dimension predictively.\n",

    "A sequence is just any enumerated collection - order counts, and repetition is allowed. Python lists are a good elemental example - `[1, 2, 2, -1]` is a valid list, and is different from `[1, 2, -1, 2]`. The data structures we tend to use (e.g. NumPy arrays) are often built on this fundamental structure.\n",

All time series are also sequences, and for some techniques you may just consider their order and not \"how far apart\" the entries are (if you have particularly consistent data collected at regular intervals it may not matter)."

    "## Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There's plenty more to \"traditional\" time series, but the latest and greatest technique for sequence data is recurrent neural networks. A recurrence relation in math is an equation that uses recursion to define a sequence - a famous example is the Fibonacci numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For formal math you also need a base case $F_0=1, F_1=1$, and then the rest builds from there. But for neural networks what we're really talking about are loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Recurrent neural network](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Recurrent_neural_network_unfold.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layers have edges (output) going back to their own input - this loop means that for any time `t` the training is at least partly based on the output from time `t-1`. The entire network is being represented on the left, and you can unfold the network explicitly to see how it behaves at any given `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different units can have this \"loop\", but a particularly successful one is the long short-term memory unit (LSTM):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Long short-term memory unit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Long_Short-Term_Memory.svg/1024px-Long_Short-Term_Memory.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot going on here - in a nutshell, the calculus still works out and backpropagation can still be implemented. The advantage (ane namesake) of LSTM is that it can generally put more weight on recent (short-term) events while not completely losing older (long-term) information.\n",
    "\n",
    "After enough iterations, a typical neural network will start calculating prior gradients that are so small they effectively become zero - this is the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem), and is what RNN with LSTM addresses. Pay special attention to the $c_t$ parameters and how they pass through the unit to get an intuition for how this problem is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why are these cool? One particularly compelling application is actually not time series but language modeling - language is inherently ordered data (letters/words go one after another, and the order *matters*). [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) is a famous and worth reading blog post on this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, let's use TensorFlow and Keras to train RNNs with natural language. Resources:\n",
