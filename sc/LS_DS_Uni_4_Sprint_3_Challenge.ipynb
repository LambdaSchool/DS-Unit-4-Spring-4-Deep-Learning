    "recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and AutoEncoders. In this sprint challenge, you will revisit these models. Remember, we are testing your knowledge of these architectures not your ability to fit a model with high accuracy. \n",

    "__*Caution:*__  these approaches can be pretty heavy computationally. All problems were designed so that you should be able to achieve results within at most 5-10 minutes of runtime on Colab or a comparable environment. If something is running longer, doublecheck your approach!\n",

    "* <a href=\"#p1\">Part 1</a>: Train a RNN classification model\n",

    "Answer the following questions, with a target audience of a fellow Data Scientist:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do you consider your strongest area, as a Data Scientist?\n",
    "- What area of Data Science would you most like to learn more about, and why?\n",
    "- Where do you think Data Science will be in 5 years?\n",
    "- What are the threats posed by AI to our society?\n",
    "- How do you think we can counteract those threats? \n",
    "- Do you think achieving General Artifical Intelligence is ever possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "A few sentences per answer is fine - only elaborate if time allows.\n",
    "- I feel that my strongest area is cleaning data because we've done so much of it every week.\n",
    "- I think NLP and CNN's are really cool.\n",
    "- I'm not sure about where Data Science will be. I do know that more and more businesses (small to big) will be hiring more data scientists and because of that, I think we'll start venturing in directions we never thought of.\n",
    "- I think the biggest one for society is AI taking jobs that people don't want and jobs that they could do. For instance, I think instead of bouncers (at bars and clubs) they'll have a scanner that you show your id in order to enter certain establishments. Likewise, security guards won't be a thing. We'll have cameras that recognize guns in certain dangeroud positions and call the police and lock the place down so they can't easily escape.\n",
    "- I'm not sure it's a bad thing that AI is taking jobs because they aren't great jobs and it'll mean that other positons are created and people start to go into alternate schooling options.\n",
    "- Not right now. We need to understand how our own brains work before we created a robot brain."
