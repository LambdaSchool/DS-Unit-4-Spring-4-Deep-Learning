    "In this sprint challenge, you'll explore some of the cutting edge of Data Science. This week we studied several famous neural network architectures: \n",
    "recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs). In this sprint challenge, you will revisit these models. Remember, we are testing your knowledge of these architectures not your ability to fit a model with high accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "__*Caution:*__  these approaches can be pretty heavy computationally. All problems were designed so that you should be able to achieve results within at most 5-10 minutes of runtime on Colab or a comparable environment. If something is running longer, doublecheck your approach!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge Objectives\n",
    "*You should be able to:*\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p1\">Part 1</a>: Train a RNN classification model\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p2\">Part 2</a>: Utilize a pre-trained CNN for objective detection\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p3\">Part 3</a>: Describe the difference between a discriminator and generator in a GAN\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p4\">Part 4</a>: Describe yourself as a Data Science and elucidate your vision of AI"

    "In a generative adverserial network, as the word 'adverserial' implies, both the discriminator and the generator algorithms are optimizing opposing loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator and the generator work within a double feedback loop model wherein the generator creates 'noise'; in other words, produces fake data, and the discriminator probabilistically decides, after receiving both 'real' output labels (the ground truth) and fake output labels from the generator, which outputs are true and which are fake. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, The discriminator is in feedback loop with the ground truth and the generator's noise, as well as with the generator. Therefore, the discriminator 'learns' to better discriminate against fake and real data as the generative algorithm becomes 'smarter' as it receives more accurate feedback from the discriminator's probabiltistic classification outputs."

    "3.I think the data science industry will continue to grow in the next 5 years, especially with the rise of non-tradional education such as coding bootcamps, which are helping reduce the entry barrier into this multi-disciplinary industry. Moreover, I believe the industry as a whole will become more segmented, as the more 'vanilla' DS becomes more widely available and the more complex (neural nets) DS areas become even more esoteric in their applications and thus even more elusive to DS practioners. \n",

    "4.One threat AI poses stems from the gap that exists between AI advances and the publics' lack of awareness of the current pace of growth in the industry. It is impossible to democratically decide what measures should be allowed for the healthy growth of AI if the majority of the world is oblvious to its current state. \n",

Just as no one could have predicted the major shift from agrarian society to industrialism, led by the industrial revolution in the late 18th century, or the internet boom in the 2000s, it is equally difficult to pinpoint how fast AI will advance in the long-term.
